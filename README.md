# Language Modeling and Classification  

This project explores **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques for **language modeling** and **text classification**. It includes the implementation and evaluation of various models to analyze text data effectively.  

## Features  

- **Language Modeling**:  
  - Implemented and tested **unigram**, **bigram**, and **trigram** models for text prediction.  

- **Text Classification**:  
  - Built and evaluated models to classify text into predefined categories.  

- **Comprehensive Workflow**:  
  - Preprocessing of textual data.  
  - Training and evaluation of multiple NLP models.  
  - Performance metrics to compare model effectiveness.  

## Tools and Technologies
